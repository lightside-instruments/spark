Spark is a modular open-source hardware platform
base board and enclosure for use as development kit for programmable
network elements.

The project includes KiCAD project with schematics
and PCB layout sources, BOM, and technical documentation for
production of board with 6x SFP+ interfaces and a 96board
extension interface for the connection of a control board 
(FPGA or ASIC) and up to 3 optional extension boards:
* glue logic for low speed signals from the optical modules
* GNSS controlled oscillators
* other interface boards, sensor boards, etc.

The project includes also technical documentation for production of
mechanical enclosure - 19 inch 1U rack mountable ESD Acrylic box compatibe
